# Geomessage
## web app - map 2 project

Post messages based on geolocation. Kind of like foursquare.
A school project, "the goal is to create a real mapping application based on the theme of your choice"

Messages and location are stored in firebase in this structure

And then retrieved using [angularfire](https://www.firebase.com/quickstart/angularjs.html) to bound to the page.
